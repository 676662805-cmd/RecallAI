    "content": "Operational risk refers to losses resulting from failed processes, systems, or human errors — rather than market or credit risk. In banking, it’s critical because even small process failures can lead to large financial or reputational losses.\nFor instance, a data entry error in a loan system or an untested change in a transaction process can cause compliance breaches. Effective control management reduces those risks and keeps customer trust."

    "topic": "What does “Control Management” mean to you? Answer Template：",
    "content": "Control Management means ensuring that business processes operate effectively and within risk and compliance standards. It’s about identifying where things could go wrong, designing controls to prevent or detect those issues, and continuously testing whether those controls work.\nFor example, in my previous project at IQVIA, we built a quality management workflow to reduce manual data errors. I helped define checkpoints and approval steps — that’s essentially applying control management principles: preventing risk before it happens."
